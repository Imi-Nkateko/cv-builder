# Approach

1. Create a new React project.
   Think about how to structure your application into components. Your application should include:

- A section to add general information like name, email and phone number.
- A section to add your educational experience (school name, title of study and date of study)
- A section to add practical experience (company name, position title, main responsibilities of your jobs, date from and until when you worked for that company)
